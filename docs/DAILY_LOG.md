### Tuesday, December 24, 2025

**Time:** [Your current time]  
**Focus:** Architecture Design

**Completed:**
- ✅ Researched Flutter architecture patterns
- ✅ Decided on Feature-first + MVVM approach
- ✅ Chose Riverpod for state management
- ✅ Defined complete folder structure
- ✅ Designed 3 core data models (Restaurant, Review, User)
- ✅ Planned Firebase Firestore structure
- ✅ Listed all required dependencies
- ✅ Documented navigation routes

**Time Spent:** 1.5 hours

**Key Decisions:**
- **Architecture:** Feature-first (easier to scale)
- **State Management:** Riverpod (type-safe, modern)
- **Router:** go_router (declarative routing)
- **Maps:** Google Maps Flutter

**Learnings:**
- Feature-first architecture makes sense for apps with distinct features
- Riverpod is more verbose but safer than Provider
- Planning data models early prevents refactoring pain later

**Challenges:**
- Deciding between Clean Architecture vs simpler approach
- Chose simpler for MVP, can refactor later if needed

**Next Steps:**
- Create UI wireframes (Issue #2)
- Setup Firebase project (Issue #3)
- Initialize Flutter project (Issue #4)

**Mood:** Productive and clear on direction! 🎯


**Update (Evening):**
- ✅ Started UI/UX design planning
- ✅ Defined color palette (Nigerian flag colors!)
- ✅ Sketched 5 main screens
- ✅ Documented design system
- ✅ Created UI_DESIGN.md

**Design Decisions:**
- Using Nigerian green (#008751) as primary color
- Simple, clean interface (not over-designed)
- Bottom navigation for main sections
- Card-based layout for restaurants

**Next:**
- Create actual wireframes/mockups
- Then move to Firebase setup

**Time spent today:** 2.5 hours total  
**Feeling:** Making solid progress! 🎨


**End of Day Update:**
- ✅ Completed progress documentation update
- ✅ Updated README, ROADMAP, CHANGELOG
- ✅ Released v0.2.0 milestone
- ✅ 2 issues closed today!

**Total time today:** 3 hours  
**Contributions today:** ~5+  
**Overall progress:** 25% of planning phase complete

**Reflection:**
Solid day of planning and documentation. Architecture and UI design 
are done. Ready to start actual implementation soon!

**Tomorrow:**
- Rest (Christmas) or start Firebase setup
- Aim for daily commits even on holidays

**Mood:** Productive and motivated! 💪
