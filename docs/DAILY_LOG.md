**Time:** [Your current time]  
**Focus:** Architecture Design

**Completed:**
- ✅ Researched Flutter architecture patterns
- ✅ Decided on Feature-first + MVVM approach
- ✅ Chose Riverpod for state management
- ✅ Defined complete folder structure
- ✅ Designed 3 core data models (Restaurant, Review, User)
- ✅ Planned Firebase Firestore structure
- ✅ Listed all required dependencies
- ✅ Documented navigation routes

**Time Spent:** 1.5 hours

**Key Decisions:**
- **Architecture:** Feature-first (easier to scale)
- **State Management:** Riverpod (type-safe, modern)
- **Router:** go_router (declarative routing)
- **Maps:** Google Maps Flutter

**Learnings:**
- Feature-first architecture makes sense for apps with distinct features
- Riverpod is more verbose but safer than Provider
- Planning data models early prevents refactoring pain later

**Challenges:**
- Deciding between Clean Architecture vs simpler approach
- Chose simpler for MVP, can refactor later if needed

**Next Steps:**
- Create UI wireframes (Issue #2)
- Setup Firebase project (Issue #3)
- Initialize Flutter project (Issue #4)

**Mood:** Productive and clear on direction! 🎯
